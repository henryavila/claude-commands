Optimized prompts you install once and invoke in any AI IDE. Each skill is an atom — small enough to stay focused, specific enough to leave no ambiguity, capable enough to make the agent actually follow through.

*Stop rewriting prompts.*

## Why Atomic?

AI agents skip steps, rationalize shortcuts, and ignore vague instructions. Atomic Skills solve this with battle-tested techniques baked into every prompt:

- **Small** — one skill, one job. No bloat, no dependencies between skills
- **Specific** — every step names the tool, demands evidence, defines what "done" looks like
- **Capable** — Iron Laws, HARD-GATEs, Red Flags, Rationalization tables. Techniques that turn "the agent should do X" into "the agent will do X"

## Multi-Agent Optimization

Atomic Skills uses a **Polyglot Rendering Engine** that detects your agent and optimizes tool naming and instructions automatically.

- **Claude Code**: Native support for `Bash`, `Read tool`, `Edit tool`, and `Agent`.
- **Gemini CLI**: Native support for `run_shell_command`, `read_file`, `replace`, and `codebase_investigator`.
- **Generic/Others**: Standardized naming for maximum compatibility.

## Skills

---

### `atomic-skills:fix` — Root Cause Diagnosis + TDD Fix

**Problem it solves:** Agents jump straight to a fix without investigating the root cause, producing fragile patches that break in other scenarios and introduce regressions.

**What it does:** Enforces a 4-phase detective process — observe evidence, diagnose with testable hypotheses, fix with TDD (test first, fix second), and verify with the full suite.

**When to use:** Whenever you find a bug or unexpected behavior in code.

**Advantages:**
- Eliminates guesswork fixes — every correction has a documented root cause with line numbers
- Test cluster covers regression, equivalence partitions, boundaries, and error inputs
- Mental mutation spot-checks verify each condition has coverage ("if I changed `>=` to `>`, would a test catch it?")
- 5-hypothesis escalation limit prevents infinite loops

**Iron Law:** `NO FIX WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE`

---

### `atomic-skills:hunt` — Adversarial Tests for Existing Code

**Problem it solves:** Code without tests or with shallow coverage hides silent bugs. Tests written "to confirm" the code (instead of breaking it) are tautological and catch nothing.

**What it does:** Writes aggressive, adversarial tests designed to *break* code, not confirm it. Single-file: 6-phase deep hunt (read, understand intent, map gaps, plan attack, write, report). Directory: triages by risk and spawns isolated subagents per file.

**When to use:** When code lacks tests, coverage is low, or you suspect untested edge cases.

**Advantages:**
- HARD-GATE against tautology: "Does the expected value come from SPEC or CODE?" — if from code, the test is useless
- Risk-based ranking for directories (0 test refs OR >8 commits = high risk)
- Isolated subagents per file prevent cross-file context contamination
- Bugs found generate a structured report with a reproducing test ready for `as-fix`

**Iron Law:** `NO HUNT WITHOUT BOUNDED SCOPE`

---

### `atomic-skills:prompt` — Optimized Prompt Generation

**Problem it solves:** Generic prompts fail because they lack exact file paths, real codebase context, and guardrails against agent shortcuts.

**What it does:** Explores the codebase first (Glob, Grep, Read), identifies relevant files and dependencies, then generates a self-contained prompt with Iron Law, tool-naming steps, Red Flags, and a task-specific Rationalization table.

**When to use:** When you need a precise prompt with exact paths and guardrails — whether to execute yourself or delegate to a subagent.

**Advantages:**
- Generated prompt has verified absolute paths (not guesses)
- Each step names the tool and requires evidence (line numbers)
- Offers 3 options: copy, execute via subagent, or adjust
- Compatible with any IDE via template variables

**Iron Law:** `NO PROMPT WITHOUT CODEBASE ANALYSIS`

---

### `atomic-skills:review-plan-internal` — Adversarial Plan Review

**Problem it solves:** Plans contain internal contradictions, broken dependencies, ambiguous tasks, and missing steps — problems that only surface during implementation, when the cost of correction is high.

**What it does:** Applies a 7-item checklist (contradictions, broken dependencies, ordering, ambiguity, schema, file existence, test coverage), cites line numbers as proof, and iterates up to 3 times to verify that fixes didn't introduce new problems.

**When to use:** Before executing any implementation plan — internal consistency validation.

**Advantages:**
- Verifies file/command existence with Glob/Grep (doesn't trust the plan)
- Severity classification: Critical (blocks), Significant (causes rework), Minor
- Verification loop prevents fixes from introducing new errors
- Every finding cites the exact plan line number

**Iron Law:** `NO APPROVAL WITHOUT EVIDENCE`

---

### `atomic-skills:review-plan-vs-artifacts` — Plan vs. Artifacts

**Problem it solves:** Plans oversimplify requirements, lose acceptance criteria details, or add features nobody asked for. The gap between PRD/spec and plan grows silently.

**What it does:** Cross-references the plan against source artifacts (PRD, specs, designs) with a 6-item checklist (requirement coverage, acceptance criteria, phase gates, dependencies, schema/API, UX). Requires line numbers from BOTH documents as proof.

**When to use:** After generating a plan from specs/PRD — cross-coverage validation.

**Advantages:**
- HARD-GATE: corrects the PLAN, never the source artifact (if the artifact has an error, asks the user)
- Coverage proof with plan line + artifact line
- Detects missing requirements, oversimplified acceptance criteria, and phantom features
- Verification loop (up to 3x) ensures fixes don't break other references

**Iron Law:** `NO APPROVAL WITHOUT CROSS-REFERENCE`

---

### `atomic-skills:save-and-push` — Save Work & Publish

**Problem it solves:** Work stays scattered in conversation, memory isn't preserved for future sessions, commits are chaotic, and secrets get accidentally committed.

**What it does:** Reviews conversation to extract learnings (saves to memory), saves work-in-progress as files, groups commits by logical unit (feature, layer, nature), formats code if configured, and pushes — with HARD-GATE on main/master.

**When to use:** At the end of a work session, or whenever you want to save progress and publish.

**Advantages:**
- Persistent memory: patterns and decisions survive between sessions
- Logically grouped commits (not a dump of everything)
- Secret filtering (.env, credentials) with mandatory STOP
- HARD-GATE prevents direct push to main/master — requires branch + PR

**Iron Law:** `NO PUSH WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION`

---

### `atomic-skills:init-memory` — Persistent Memory Initialization

**Problem it solves:** Projects have memory scattered across different locations (`.memory/`, `.claude/memory/`, `docs/memory/`, etc.), causing duplication, context loss, and inconsistency.

**What it does:** Detects existing memory in all known locations, migrates to the canonical path (`.ai/memory/`), organizes by theme, configures Claude Code integration (`autoMemoryDirectory`), and cleans up original directories (with confirmation).

**When to use:** When starting a new project or standardizing memory structure for an existing one.

**Advantages:**
- Single canonical location, versioned in git and shared with the team
- Respects the 200-line MEMORY.md limit (content beyond is silently truncated by Claude)
- Safe migration: copies first, validates, only removes originals with confirmation
- `autoMemoryDirectory` support for direct integration (no redirect needed)

**Iron Law:** `NO DELETION WITHOUT CONFIRMED BACKUP`

## Techniques

Each skill uses a combination of these techniques to prevent agent shortcuts:

| Technique | What it does | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Iron Law** | One non-negotiable rule at the top | `NO FIX WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE` |
| **HARD-GATE** | Mandatory stop before a dangerous action | "If modifying code without a test: STOP" |
| **Red Flags** | Thoughts that mean you're skipping steps | "I already know what the bug is" |
| **Rationalization Table** | Maps tempting shortcuts to why they fail | "The fix is obvious" → "Obvious to whom? Prove it" |
| **Evidence Requirement** | Every claim must cite line numbers or tool output | "Cite file:line, not 'I checked'" |
| **Escalation Limit** | Max attempts before asking the human | "5 hypotheses failed → escalate" |
| **Test List** | Enumerate test surface before writing any test | Regression + partitions + boundaries + errors |
| **Mental Mutation** | For each condition in the fix: "would a test catch the inverse?" | "If I changed >= to >, would a test catch it?" |
| **Autonomous Mode** | Rules for subagents that can't interact with user | "Auto-split >300 lines, always continue on bugs" |

## Development & Quality Assurance

To ensure cross-agent compatibility, Atomic Skills includes a specialized test suite that acts as a linter for prompt templates.

```bash
npm test
```

The test suite verifies:
1. **Tool Name Abstraction**: Ensures no hardcoded tool names (like `Bash` or `Read tool`) exist in the source `.md` files.
2. **Conditional Rendering**: Validates that agent-specific instructions are correctly included/excluded for Claude and Gemini.
3. **Multi-Format Export**: Verifies Markdown and TOML generation for all supported profiles.

When creating new skills, always use the variables defined in `AGENTS.md`.
