Maintain canonical per-initiative status in `.atomic-skills/` — read, create, update, display.

## Iron Law

NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT ANCHORED INITIATIVE.

Every code-modifying session must be anchored to an active initiative in `.atomic-skills/initiatives/<slug>.md`, or the user must explicitly declare "ad-hoc".

## Initial detection

Run with {{BASH_TOOL}}:
- `test -d .atomic-skills/` — if absent, enter setup mode
- If present, read `.atomic-skills/PROJECT-STATUS.md` and determine active initiative

## Modes

See sections below per {{ARG_VAR}}.

(Full implementation in plan tasks 11-15.)
